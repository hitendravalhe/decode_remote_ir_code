we can get the ir code of any button of any type of remote by this code

  The TSOP IR sensor is a popular infrared sensor that can be used to detect and receive IR signals from remote controls. Interfacing the TSOP IR sensor with an Arduino board allows you to capture IR codes from any type of remote control and print them on the serial monitor.

To interface the TSOP IR sensor with an Arduino board, you will need to connect the sensor to the board using the following pins:

VS: This pin is connected to the 5V pin on the Arduino board.
GND: This pin is connected to the GND pin on the Arduino board.
OUT: This pin is connected to any digital pin on the Arduino board. In this example, we will use pin 10.
Once you have connected the TSOP IR sensor to the Arduino board, you can use the IRremote library to capture IR codes from any type of remote control. Here's an example Arduino code that captures IR codes and prints them on the serial monitor:

our code initializes the IR receiver on pin 11 and waits for an IR code to be received. Once an IR code is received, the code is printed on the serial monitor in hexadecimal format. The irrecv.resume() function enables the IR receiver to receive more codes.

With this code, you can use any type of remote control to capture its IR codes and print them on the serial monitor. You can then use these codes to control other devices using the IRremote library.
